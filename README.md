# A simple Javascript calculator.

I wanted to practice more on my CSS skills and I found a cool design for a calculator on Figma (credits to the Author below) - so I wanted to try to create a calculator using the design as reference as best as I could.


The calculator is capable of performing all basic math calculations and there's a button to clear the display.


Thanks to the design author Ganesh Sekhar:
